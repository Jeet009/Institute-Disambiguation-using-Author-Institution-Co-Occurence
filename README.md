## 📘 Overview

Using **Crossref metadata**, we have devised a novel method to perform **Institute Disambiguation**.  
While most existing approaches rely heavily on **string matching**, our approach takes a **radically different perspective** — leveraging **co-occurrences of Author–Affiliation pairs** to disambiguate institutional identities more effectively.

This approach not only enhances accuracy but also scales efficiently with large datasets, making it suitable for modern research pipelines.

## 🚀 Running the Notebook in Google Colab

You can easily run the **Institute Disambiguation** notebook using **Google Colab**.

1. Open the notebook directly in Colab by clicking this badge:  
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](YOUR_NOTEBOOK_LINK_HERE)

2. Once opened:
   - Make sure you **enable TPU runtime**:  
     Go to `Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > TPU`
   - Then, run all cells sequentially:  
     `Runtime > Run all`
   - Skip the cells with *IGNORE* comment above it. (IF ANY)

3. Outputs (results, logs, and visualizations) will be generated directly in Colab.
